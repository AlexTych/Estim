At present, user data is not stored on the server. However, in the future, I plan to integrate Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) for seamless data management.

## About

The driving force behind creating Estim was to develop an application for personal usage. Originally, it was built using Dart and Flutter as a multi-platform application. 
In addition, I've decided to create an alternative version using the Angular framework, coupled with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RxJs, and HighCharts libraries. 
This endeavor not only enhances my professional portfolio but also expands the reach and usability of Estim.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Follow the installation instructions in the `README.md` file to set up the application locally.
